# Spøke

**Spøke** is a Norwegian word game -- it is an implementation of the classic
game [Ghost]. The gameplay is simple: taking turns, players will add a letter at
a time. The objective is the spell _towards_ a word, but the player who
completes a word (any word!) will lose. That player will gain an "S" then "P",
then "Ø", ... until someone loses.
