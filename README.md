# Spøke

**Spøke** is a Norwegian word game -- it is an implementation of the classic
game [Ghost]. The gameplay is simple: taking turns, players will add a letter at
a time. The objective is the spell _towards_ a word, but the player who
completes a word (any word!) will lose. That player will gain an "S" then "P",
then "Ø", ... until someone loses.

## Architecture

This is a React-based application, which runs entirely in the browser. It is
free to play and ad-free.

## Contribution

Please open a pull request (or issue) if you have an idea or find a bug.

Please note that this currently depends on a private repo for the word list.
You will need to ignore this when cloning and source your own word list from a
data set.
